Example03
=========
  Geant4_VMC Example03 adapted to demonstrate the usage of sharing event
  simulation between multiple engines.

  Demonstrates:
    Geometry - divided volume (Gsdvn), defined via TGeo only
    Definition of sensitive volumes
    Physics - hadronics processes off
    Particles cuts
      - G4 cut in range: 1mm
        G3 cuts set to correspond to 1mm cut in range
    Primary generator with randomized position (optional)
      defined number of electrons with moving position and fixed direction
    Calorimetry hits
    Storing hits, particles stack in Root file
    Drawing geometry (G3+TGeo, G4) + trajectories (G3+TGeo and G4)
    Verbosity
    Geometry defined via Geant4 (G4)
    User defined physics list (G4)
    User defined particles and ions (G3+TGeo, G4)
    User defined regions (G4)
    User defined magnetic field equation of motion and/or its integrator (G4)
    The transport in a multi run is shared such that the ABSO and GAPX volumes
      are simulated using different engines, namely one by GEANT3 and the other
      one by GEANT4

  See also description of in
    geant4_vmc/examples/E03/README

Compilation:
============
  With G4:
  An extra library with user defined Geant4 based classes has to be build:

  cd EME/geant4
  gmake

  Use of user own defined physics list is demonstrated on
  the FTFP_BERT hadronics physics list provided in Geant4.


Macros:
=======

  For running example with G3:

  load_g3.C       - macro to load the libraries to run the example with Geant3
  run_g3.C        - macro for running example
  g3tgeoConfig.C  - configuration macro for G3 with TGeo geometry

  For running example with G4:

  load_g4.C           - macro to load the libraries to run the example with Geant
  run_g4.C            - macro for running example
  g4tgeoConfig.C      - configuration macro - G4 with TGeo navigation
                                              and FTFP_BERT hadronics physics list provided in Geant4
  g4tgeoConfig1.C     - configuration macro - user defined regions, TGeo navigation and
                                              FTFP_BERT hadronics physics list
  g4tgeoConfig2.C     - configuration macro - activation of VMC cuts and process controls, TGeo navigation
                                              and FTFP_BERT hadronics physics list
  g4tgeoConfigEnv.C   - configuration macro - physics list defined via environment variable
                                              and TGeo navigation
  g4config.in         - macro for G4 configuration using G4 commands (called from g4tgeoConfig*.C)
  g4vis.in            - macro for G4 visualization settings (called from set_vis.C)

  Common macro (called by run_g3.C/run_g4.C):

  set_vis.C - setting visualization
