Example03c
==========
  Geant4_VMC Example03 adapted to demonstrate the usage of sharing event
  simulation between multiple engines.

  Demonstrates:
    Geometry - divided volume (Gsdvn), defined via TGeo only
    Definition of sensitive volumes
    Physics - hadronics processes off
    Particles cuts
      - G4 cut in range: 1mm
        G3 cuts set to correspond to 1mm cut in range
    Primary generator with randomized position (optional)
      defined number of electrons with moving position and fixed direction
    Calorimetry hits
    Storing hits, particles stack in Root file
    Drawing geometry (G3+TGeo, G4) + trajectories (G3+TGeo and G4)
    Verbosity
    Geometry defined via Geant4 (G4)
    User defined physics list (G4)
    User defined particles and ions (G3+TGeo, G4)
    User defined regions (G4)
    User defined magnetic field equation of motion and/or its integrator (G4)
    The transport in a multi run is shared such that the ABSO and GAPX volumes
      are simulated using different engines, namely one by GEANT3 and the other
      one by GEANT4

    geant4_vmc/examples/E03/README

Macros:
=======
  load_multi.C     - macro to load the libraries
  run_multi.C            - macro for running example

  Common macro (called by run_g3.C/run_g4.C):

  set_vis.C - setting visualization

To run example with mixed engines:
==================================

  With G3 mixed with G4 both using TGeo navigation:
  root[0] .x load_multi.C
  root[1] .x run_multi.C
